# Information-Retrieval

To implement information retrieval using a supervised machine learning algorithm, we can use a text classification approach. I'll demonstrate how to train a classifier using the Naive Bayes algorithm on the 20 Newsgroups dataset.

The 20 Newsgroups dataset is a collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents across 20 different topics. You can download it using scikit-learn's dataset module.

Here's an example code that demonstrates information retrieval using the Naive Bayes classifier on the 20 Newsgroups dataset:

In the code above, we start by downloading the 20 Newsgroups dataset using fetch_20newsgroups. We specify subset='all' to fetch the entire dataset, and remove unnecessary parts like headers, footers, and quotes using remove=('headers', 'footers', 'quotes').

Next, we split the dataset into training and testing sets. In this example, we use the first 15,000 documents for training and the remaining documents for testing.

We then use the TfidfVectorizer to convert the text data into numerical feature vectors. The TfidfVectorizer computes the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) representation of the text data, which is a commonly used feature representation for text classification tasks.

After vectorizing the text data, we create an instance of the MultinomialNB classifier, which is a Naive Bayes algorithm suitable for text classification tasks. We train the classifier using the training set by calling the fit method and passing in the vectorized training data and corresponding labels.

Next, we make predictions on the test set using the trained classifier by calling the predict method on the vectorized test data.

Finally, we calculate the accuracy of the classifier by comparing the predicted labels (y_pred) with the true labels (y_test) using the accuracy_score function and print the accuracy.

Note that the code provided assumes you have scikit-learn installed (pip install scikit-learn).
